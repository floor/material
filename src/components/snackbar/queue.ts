 * Creates a queue manager for snackbars

 * a new snackbar is added (see {@link SnackbarQueueAddOptions}):
 * - `'queue'` (default): the snackbar waits its turn and is shown in order.
 * - `'replace'`: the snackbar evicts whatever is currently on screen, drops any
 *   still-pending snackbars, and shows immediately. This keeps rapid, repeated
 *   actions snappy instead of serializing a long backlog.
 *
 * @param {number} gap - Delay in ms between a dismissed snackbar and the next
 * @returns {SnackbarQueue} Queue manager with add/clear methods
