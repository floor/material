 * Enable declarative shadow DOM for mtrl/react in this server process.

 * The server-rendered shadow root is built in a separate render, without the context of providers above the component.
 * The page's own render (the light DOM) sees the provided value. Until upgrade, a child reading context with a default shows that default in the painted shadow root; a child requiring its context leaves this component without a declarative shadow root while the page still renders.
 * The Vue and Solid bridges see the provided value in both the shadow root and light DOM. Svelte has this same context limit and logs a development-only warning naming the element when required context leaves it without a shadow root.
 * Pass the resolved string as a prop or attribute, or accept client-rendered text until the upgrade. A fix is planned for 1.1 (FLO-517).
