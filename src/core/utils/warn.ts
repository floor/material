// FLO-106. The rule for selection components is that a value no option
// carries clears the selection, the same as native `<select>` setting
// `selectedIndex = -1`. Clearing silently is indistinguishable from a typo,
// so it warns -- but only where a warning helps, which is not production.
//
// The guard is written defensively rather than as a bare
// `process.env.NODE_ENV`. The CommonJS bundle has that expression replaced at
// build time (`scripts/build.ts`), but the ESM modules are emitted by tsc, which
// substitutes nothing. A consumer loading those modules straight into a
// browser has no `process`, and a bare read would throw where the library is
// only trying to warn. The cost of `typeof process` is that raw-browser ESM
// gets no warning; throwing instead would be worse.
