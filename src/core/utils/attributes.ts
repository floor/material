/**
 * HTML attributes whose presence alone means true.
 *
 * The parser does not read their value: `disabled="false"`, `disabled=""` and
 * `disabled="disabled"` are all a disabled control. So writing `String(false)`
 * for one of these produces the opposite of what the caller asked for:
 * `createElement({ disabled: false })` returned a disabled
 * button, and the same inversion reached `checked`, `required` and `hidden`.
 *
 * The list is the HTML boolean attributes a component configuration is
 * plausibly built from. It is deliberately a known set rather than "any false
 * value", because two neighbouring families would be caught by that rule and
 * must not be:
 *
 *   - `aria-*`, where `aria-hidden="false"` is meaningful and differs from the
 *     attribute being absent. Dropping it changes what assistive technology
 *     reports.
 *   - `data-*`, where "false" is an ordinary string an application may read
 *     back with `dataset.x === "false"`.
