# mtrl

Material Design 3 components for the web: as plain JavaScript, as web components, and as React, Vue, Svelte and Solid components. Written in TypeScript, with zero dependencies.

mtrl implements the M3 Expressive update: component sizes, shapes, colours and spring motion follow the Material 3 tokens. One implementation serves every way of using it, so a button looks and behaves the same in each. The documentation site, [md3.io](https://md3.io), has a live playground and examples in every framework for each component.

## Install

```bash
npm install mtrl
```

React, Vue, Svelte and Solid are optional peer dependencies: mtrl uses the one your app has and installs none of them.

## Use it your way

| Way | Import from | Good for |
|-----|-------------|----------|
| Web components | `mtrl/elements` | Plain HTML, server templates, Angular, any framework |
| React | `mtrl/react` | React 18 and 19, Next.js |
| Vue | `mtrl/vue` | Vue 3, Nuxt |
| Svelte | `mtrl/svelte` | Svelte 5, SvelteKit |
| Solid | `mtrl/solid` | SolidJS, SolidStart |
| Vanilla factories | `mtrl` | The smallest bundles and full control |

Every app imports the base stylesheet once: the theme, the tokens and the ripple.

```typescript
import 'mtrl/styles/base';
```

**Web components**: register them once, then write HTML.

```html
<script type="module">
  import 'mtrl/styles/base';
  import 'mtrl/elements/css';
  import { defineAll } from 'mtrl/elements';
  defineAll();
</script>

<form>
  <m-textfield name="email" type="email" label="Email" required></m-textfield>
  <m-switch name="news" checked>Newsletter</m-switch>
  <m-button type="submit">Sign up</m-button>
</form>
```

**React** (Vue, Svelte and Solid work the same way, see [below](#react-vue-svelte-and-solid)):

```tsx
import 'mtrl/styles/base';
import { Button, Switch, Textfield } from 'mtrl/react';

export function Signup() {
  return (
    <form>
      <Textfield name="email" type="email" label="Email" required />
      <Switch name="news" defaultChecked>Newsletter</Switch>
      <Button type="submit">Sign up</Button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

**Vanilla**: each component is a function that returns a DOM element and a small API.

```typescript
import 'mtrl/styles';
import { createButton, createTextfield } from 'mtrl';

const name = createTextfield({ label: 'Name' });
const save = createButton({ text: 'Save', variant: 'filled' });
save.disabled.disable();

name.on('input', ({ value }: { value: string }) => {
  if (value.trim()) save.disabled.enable();
  else save.disabled.disable();
});
save.on('click', () => console.log('Saved', name.getValue()));

document.body.append(name.element, save.element);

// When the view goes away, release listeners and DOM
name.destroy();
save.destroy();
```

The factories are the fastest way to render hundreds of components at once, such as a long editable table; the elements style a shadow root each. `mtrl/styles` loads every component's styles; for a smaller bundle, import only what you use (see [Styles](#styles)).

## Components

Every component comes three ways: a factory (`createButton`), an element (`<m-button>`) and a framework component (`Button`; `MButton` in Vue).

| Group | Components |
|-------|------------|
| Actions | Button, Icon button, Button group, Split button, FAB, Extended FAB, FAB menu, Toolbar |
| Selection and input | Checkbox, Switch, Radio buttons, Chips, Slider, Text field, Select, Search, Date picker, Time picker |
| Navigation | Navigation rail, Drawer, Tabs, Menu, Top app bar, Bottom app bar |
| Containment | Card, Carousel, List, Divider, Dialog, Bottom sheet, Side sheet |
| Communication | Badge, Progress, Loading indicator, Snackbar, Tooltip |

The factories are exported from `mtrl`: `createButton`, `createIconButton`, `createButtonGroup`, `createSplitButton`, `createFab`, `createExtendedFab`, `createFabMenu`, `createToolbar`, `createCheckbox`, `createSwitch`, `createRadios`, `createChips` (with `createAssistChip`, `createFilterChip`, `createInputChip` and `createSuggestionChip`), `createSlider`, `createTextfield`, `createSelect`, `createSearch`, `createDatePicker`, `createTimePicker`, `createNavigationRail`, `createDrawer`, `createTabs` and `createTab`, `createMenu`, `createTopAppBar`, `createBottomAppBar`, `createCard` (with `createCardHeader`, `createCardContent`, `createCardMedia` and `createCardActions`), `createCarousel`, `createList`, `createDivider`, `createDialog`, `createBottomSheet`, `createSideSheet`, `createBadge`, `createProgress`, `createLoadingIndicator`, `createSnackbar` and `createTooltip`. Deprecated: `createSegmentedButton` and `createSegment`, replaced by `createButtonGroup` with `kind: 'connected'`.

## Styles

The web components and the framework components carry their own styles in their shadow roots; they need only the base stylesheet, `mtrl/styles/base`, for the theme and its tokens. The factories render in the page, so they use the page's stylesheets. Import the full stylesheet once:

```typescript
import 'mtrl/styles';
```

Or import the base once, followed by the components you use:

```typescript
import 'mtrl/styles/base';
import 'mtrl/styles/button';
import 'mtrl/styles/textfield';

// Optional: an alternate theme and the utility classes
import 'mtrl/themes/ocean';
import 'mtrl/styles/utilities';
```

The base includes the baseline theme in light and dark, the tokens, a reset, typography and the ripple. Each selective entry imports what it depends on (the select brings the text field and the menu), so use a CSS-capable bundler to resolve and deduplicate them. Choose either the full stylesheet or selective imports, not both.

Library styles sit in ordered `mtrl` cascade layers, so unlayered application CSS overrides them without specificity battles.

### Themes

The baseline theme applies by default and follows the system light or dark preference. Choose a theme and mode on the root element:

```html
<html data-theme="ocean" data-theme-mode="dark">
```

```typescript
document.documentElement.dataset.theme = 'ocean';
document.documentElement.dataset.themeMode = 'dark';
```

Available themes: `baseline`, `ocean`, `desert`, `forest`, `sunset`, `spring`, `summer`, `autumn`, `brownbeige`, `sageivory`, `tealcaramel` and `highcontrast`. With selective styles, import the theme's entry, for example `mtrl/themes/ocean`.

Every theme supports `data-theme-contrast="standard"`, `"medium"` and `"high"` on the same element as `data-theme` and `data-theme-mode`:

```html
<html data-theme="desert" data-theme-mode="dark" data-theme-contrast="high">
```

Without `data-theme-contrast`, `prefers-contrast: more` selects high contrast. An explicit `standard` opts out; `medium` overrides the preference too. The default baseline also supports this setting without `data-theme`. Medium and high use M3 contrast levels 0.5 and 1.0; hand-authored themes derive them with Tonal Spot from their light primary, while their standard colors stay unchanged. Success, warning and info keep their existing status colors. The `highcontrast` theme is a theme in its own right and supports all three contrast settings.

M3's scheme variants, generated from the baseline seed, ship as their own entries only (not in the full stylesheet): `neutral`, `vibrant`, `expressive`, `fidelity`, `content`, `monochrome`, `rainbow` and `fruit-salad`, for example `mtrl/themes/vibrant`. `schemeToTokens` (`mtrl/core/theme`) turns any M3 scheme's role colours into these tokens.

Deprecated, removed in 1.0: `material` (use `baseline`), `winter` (use `ocean`), `browngreen` (use `brownbeige`) and `legacy`.

### Custom properties

Components read the theme's colour roles, so overriding a role restyles every component that uses it:

```css
:root {
  --mtrl-sys-color-primary: #6750a4;
  --mtrl-sys-color-on-primary: #ffffff;
}
```

The type scale, the typefaces and the corner scale are custom properties too (`--mtrl-sys-typescale-*`, `--mtrl-ref-typeface-brand` and `--mtrl-ref-typeface-plain`, `--mtrl-sys-shape-corner-*`): setting a typeface or a corner step on `:root` restyles every component that uses it. Component hooks follow one convention, `--mtrl-<component>-<name>`:

```css
.brand-slider {
  --mtrl-slider-color: #006a6a;
  --mtrl-slider-on-color: #ffffff;
}
```

## Web components

Overlays open in the browser's top layer (`showModal()` or `popover`) from inside their own shadow root, so they keep their styles, trap focus and make the page inert where M3 says so. Form controls are form-associated: `name`, the form value, reset, validation, `<label for>` and back-navigation restore work as on native controls.

Declaration children describe a component's items, as native `<select>` and `<option>` do:

```html
<m-tabs value="songs">
  <m-tab value="songs">Songs</m-tab>
  <m-tab value="albums">Albums</m-tab>
</m-tabs>
```

The page still loads mtrl's base styles and a theme (see [Styles](#styles)); the elements render in shadow DOM and pick up the theme's tokens. Attributes are defaults and properties the live state, as on native controls: a `checked` or `value` attribute sets the state until the user or a script changes it, and `form.reset()` goes back to it. Form controls take part in forms (their host's `name`), reset, validation and back-navigation restore.

A server-rendered page sends each element as its tag and light DOM; the element takes its real look once its script defines it. So that nothing moves meanwhile, put the pre-upgrade stylesheet in `<head>`: it gives every element not defined yet the box it will have (and its label the final type style), hides what it declares (`<m-tab>`, `<m-menu-item>`, …) and overlays. Its rules match only `:not(:defined)`, in the `mtrl.preupgrade` cascade layer.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/node_modules/mtrl/dist/elements/preupgrade.css">
```

With another tag prefix, `preupgradeStyles('x')` from `mtrl/elements/preupgrade` returns the same stylesheet for `<x-*>`, to inline on the server. The CSS modules (`mtrl/elements/css`) also apply these rules until the elements are defined, for the default prefix and the one given to `configure()` or `define()`.

## React, Vue, Svelte and Solid

The framework components render the elements, so everything above holds: forms, the top layer, the styling. `mtrl/react`, `mtrl/vue`, `mtrl/svelte` and `mtrl/solid` load the elements' CSS and register each element the first time it mounts.

| Framework | Import | Two-way binding |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| React 18 and 19 | `import { Switch } from 'mtrl/react'` | `checked` + `onChange`, or `defaultChecked` |
| Vue 3 | `import { MSwitch } from 'mtrl/vue'` | `v-model` |
| Svelte 5 | `import { Switch } from 'mtrl/svelte'` | `bind:checked` |
| Solid | `import { Switch } from 'mtrl/solid'` | `checked` + `onChange` |

Each framework is an optional peer dependency; mtrl installs none of them. All adapters render on the server and hydrate. Angular apps use the elements directly, with `CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA`.

Each framework has a guide on [md3.io](https://md3.io/docs/): props and events, controlled and uncontrolled state, named slots, refs and server rendering.

## Imports and tree-shaking

mtrl publishes ESM with type declarations, so bundlers drop unused exports and split dynamic imports. CommonJS remains available through `require('mtrl')`.

| Import | Path |
|--------|------|
| Component creators | `import { createButton } from 'mtrl'` |
| One component directly | `import createSlider from 'mtrl/components/slider'` |
| Component constants | `import { BUTTON_VARIANTS } from 'mtrl/components/button/constants'` |
| Core utilities | `import { addClass, removeClass } from 'mtrl/core/dom'` |

Constants are not exported from the root; import them from the component's `constants` entry:

```typescript
import { createButton } from 'mtrl';
import { BUTTON_VARIANTS, BUTTON_SIZES } from 'mtrl/components/button/constants';

const button = createButton({
  text: 'Submit',
  variant: BUTTON_VARIANTS.FILLED,
  size: BUTTON_SIZES.L,
});
```

Some parts load on demand: a button's progress indicator, a card's action buttons, a menu's submenus and the FAB menu's desktop menu. Enable code splitting in your build to keep them out of the initial chunk.

## Building your own components

Components are composed from small features with `pipe`. The same building blocks are public:

```typescript
import { pipe, createBase, withEvents, withElement } from 'mtrl/core/compose';

const createNote = (config: { text?: string } = {}) =>
  pipe(
    createBase,
    withEvents(),
    withElement({ tag: 'div', componentName: 'note' }),
    (component) => ({
      ...component,
      setText(text: string) {
        component.element.textContent = text;
      },
    })
  )(config);

// The component's type is what the pipe builds
type NoteComponent = ReturnType<typeof createNote>;

const note: NoteComponent = createNote();
note.setText('Saved');
document.body.append(note.element);
```

The element gets the `mtrl-note` class, `withEvents` adds `on`, `off` and `emit`, and `destroy()` removes the element. Add `withLifecycle()` from `mtrl/core/compose/features` when features need to register cleanup.

## Markup and sanitizing

Icons and `content` options are markup strings, written with `innerHTML`. Every such write goes through one sink, so you can decide once how markup is treated. Set a policy when the strings can come from users or a CMS, or when your page enforces Trusted Types:

```typescript
import { configureHTML } from 'mtrl';

// A sanitizer
configureHTML({ sanitize: (html) => DOMPurify.sanitize(html) });

// Trusted Types: under `require-trusted-types-for 'script'` a plain string
// assignment throws, so return a TrustedHTML from a policy your CSP allows
const policy = window.trustedTypes.createPolicy('mtrl', {
  createHTML: (html) => DOMPurify.sanitize(html),
});
configureHTML({ sanitize: (html) => policy.createHTML(html) });
```

The policy sees every string, the library's own icons included; a `TrustedHTML` value passed as an icon or content skips it. With no policy set, markup is written as it is. Text options (`text`, a card's `text`) never go through `innerHTML`.

## Upgrading from 0.9

0.10.0 adds the elements and framework components; for factory users, most apps need nothing. The changes to check are listed in the [0.10.0 changelog's migration section](CHANGELOG.md#migrating-from-09x): setters no longer emit `change`, the time picker's events pass `{ value }`, the `--mtrl-sys-color-*-rgb` properties are gone, disabled non-form roots use `aria-disabled`, cards are `article`s, and the text field's DOM gained a `__field` wrapper.

## Upgrading from 0.7

0.8.0 aligns the components with Material 3 expressive, and some of that changes the API or the styles:

- `createSheet` is removed; use `createBottomSheet` or `createSideSheet`.
- FAB and extended FAB: `variant: 'primary'`, `'secondary'` and `'tertiary'` are now the tone styles; the former look is `'primary-container'` (the default), `'secondary-container'` and `'tertiary-container'`.
- `createSegmentedButton` is deprecated in favour of `createButtonGroup({ kind: 'connected' })`; its heights are now 40, 36 and 32px by density.
- Component custom properties are renamed to `--mtrl-<component>-<name>`, for example `--drawer-width` to `--mtrl-drawer-width` and `--item-offset` to `--mtrl-list-item-offset`.
- `title-large` uses weight 400, as M3 specifies.
- The slider draws with DOM and CSS; styles for `.mtrl-slider-canvas` no longer apply.

The full list, with every renamed property, is in the [0.8.0 changelog](CHANGELOG.md#080---2026-09-15).

## Browser support

Current Chrome, Edge, Firefox and Safari. The spring motion uses CSS `linear()` easing (Safari 17.2 or later); older browsers render every component but skip those transitions. The elements use form-associated custom elements and the top layer (`popover` and `<dialog>`), both available in every current browser.
