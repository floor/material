# Contributing to mtrl

Thank you for your interest in contributing to mtrl! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing to this lightweight, TypeScript-focused UI component library.

## Why Contribute?

mtrl aims to be a modern, flexible UI component library with:

- Zero dependencies (except Bun for development)
- TypeScript-first codebase
- Lightweight, tree-shakable components
- Simple and extensible API
- Excellent documentation

By contributing to mtrl, you'll help create a lean alternative to heavier frameworks while gaining experience with modern TypeScript patterns and component design.

## Getting Started

### Development Environment

1. **Fork and clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/mtrl.git
   cd mtrl
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

### Testing Your Components with md3.io

mtrl's documentation site, [md3.io](https://md3.io), is a separate repository ([floor/md3.io](https://github.com/floor/md3.io)) with a playground for every component. To see your changes there, clone it beside your mtrl checkout; it depends on `file:../mtrl`:

```bash
# Next to the mtrl repository
git clone https://github.com/floor/md3.io.git
cd md3.io
bun install

# Serves http://localhost:4300 and rebuilds mtrl, then the site, when mtrl/src changes
bun run dev
```

## Contribution Workflow

1. **Pick an issue or feature** - Start with issues labeled `good-first-issue` or `help-wanted`.

2. **Create a branch** - Name your branch based on what you're working on:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/button-improvements
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/textfield-validation
   ```

3. **Make your changes** - Follow the coding standards and guidelines below.

4. **Test your changes** - Use the playground app to test your components in real-time.

5. **Submit a pull request** - Include a detailed description of your changes and reference any related issues.

## Development Guidelines

### Component Structure

mtrl components follow a consistent pattern:

```typescript
// src/components/mycomponent/index.ts
export { createMyComponent } from './mycomponent';
export type { MyComponentOptions } from './types';

// src/components/mycomponent/types.ts
export interface MyComponentOptions {
  text?: string;
  onClick?: (event: MouseEvent) => void;
  // other options...
}

// src/components/mycomponent/mycomponent.ts
import { createElement } from '../../core/dom/create';
import { createLifecycle } from '../../core/state/lifecycle';
import type { MyComponentOptions } from './types';

/**
 * Creates a new MyComponent instance
 * @param options - Configuration options for MyComponent
 * @returns The MyComponent instance
 */
export const createMyComponent = (options: MyComponentOptions = {}) => {
  // Create DOM elements
  const element = createElement({...});
  
  // Setup state and features
  const lifecycle = createLifecycle(element);
  
  // Return component API
  return {
    element,
    // Other public methods...
    destroy() {
      lifecycle.destroy();
    }
  };
};
```

### Using md3.io for Development

md3.io is the best place to develop and test your components (see "Testing Your Components with md3.io" above to run it):

1. Its playgrounds are configured in `src/shared/components.ts` of the md3.io repository.
2. Component documentation lives in its `docs/components/`, and `bun run docs:check` checks every example against your mtrl checkout.
3. `bun run dev` rebuilds mtrl and the site whenever `mtrl/src` changes.

This separation of the library code (mtrl) and the documentation site (md3.io) keeps the main library clean while providing a rich development environment.

### TypeScript Standards

- Use TypeScript's type system to create clear interfaces and types
- Export types and interfaces separately from implementations
- Use strict typing and avoid `any` when possible
- Prefer interfaces for public APIs and type aliases for complex types
- Add proper return types to all functions

### Coding Standards

- Add file path as a comment on the first line of each file
- Use functional programming principles when possible
- Use consistent naming conventions:
  - Factory functions should be named `createXyz`
  - Utilities should use clear, descriptive names
  - Interfaces should be named in PascalCase (e.g., `ButtonOptions`)
- Write TypeDoc comments for all public functions and types

### CSS/SCSS Guidelines

- Use BEM-style naming: `mtrl-component__element--modifier`
- Keep specificity low
- Use CSS variables for theming
- Organize styles in the `src/components/*/styles.scss` file

## Distribution checks

After building, check the packed distribution before a release:

```bash
bun run build
bun run size:check
```

The size check packs and installs the local distribution in a temporary directory, checks Node ESM/CommonJS and TypeScript imports, and measures minified consumer bundles with gzip and Brotli. It enforces budgets for individual imports, a form, CSS, and the initial button chunks. Results are saved to `analysis/package-size.json`. It does not rebuild `dist`.

For a second bundler and real-browser checks:

```bash
node node_modules/playwright/cli.js install chromium
bun run consumer:check
```

This builds a packed Vite application and checks tree-shaking, CSS deduplication, and on-demand progress loading. Chromium compares the full and selective stylesheets with screenshots and computed styles across component states, the baseline and ocean themes, light and dark modes, and desktop and mobile widths, and exercises pointer and keyboard interactions. Reports and screenshots are saved to `analysis/browser`; CI runs these checks and uploads the artifacts. The comparisons use the full stylesheet from the same build as their reference, so they test distribution equivalence rather than a separate design baseline.

`scripts/style-manifest.ts` declares the selective style entries and their dependencies. The build rejects missing dependencies and cycles, checks the manifest against Sass's parsed full-stylesheet imports, and verifies the component dependencies retained by tree-shaking, including lazy imports.

`bun run slider:check` covers slider geometry, keyboard, pointer, resize and lifecycle. To compare with a previous build, pass `--reference=<directory>` to `scripts/check-slider.ts`; the directory must contain an ESM `slider.js` exporting `createSlider` and its full `styles.css`. Screenshots and measurements go to `analysis/slider-dom`.

Builds fail on TypeScript or Sass errors. The published ESM is readable and includes declarations; source maps are left out of the package to keep installs small.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your code follows the style guidelines
2. Update documentation as needed
3. Include a clear description of the changes
4. Reference any issues that are being addressed
5. Wait for review and address any feedback

## Testing

Please add appropriate tests for your changes:

```typescript
// Example test structure
describe('myComponent', () => {
  it('should render correctly', () => {
    // Test code
  });
  
  it('should handle user interaction', () => {
    // Test code
  });
});
```

## Documentation

Documentation is crucial for this project:

- Add TypeDoc comments for all public API methods and types
- Comment the file path at the top of each file
- Update the component's README.md (if applicable)
- Consider adding example code in the playground

Example of proper TypeDoc:

```typescript
/**
 * Creates a button element with specified options
 * 
 * @param options - The button configuration options
 * @returns A button component instance
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const button = createButton({ text: 'Click me', variant: 'primary' });
 * document.body.appendChild(button.element);
 * ```
 */
```

Thank you for contributing to mtrl! Your efforts help make this library better for everyone.

## Releasing

Releases are published by GitHub Actions with npm trusted publishing
(`.github/workflows/release.yml`); no npm token is involved.

1. On `main`, bump the version in `package.json` in its own commit:
   `chore(release): x.y.z`. A pre-release is `x.y.z-next.N`.
2. Tag that commit `vx.y.z` and push the tag:

   ```bash
   git tag vx.y.z
   git push origin vx.y.z
   ```

3. The workflow checks that the tag matches the version, builds, and
   publishes: a pre-release under the `next` dist-tag, a release under
   `latest`. `npm view mtrl dist-tags` confirms.
