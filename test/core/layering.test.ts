// Core does not import from components.
//
// `core/config/global.ts` hardcoded a `ComponentConfigMap` naming
// nine components and importing their config types, which inverted the
// layering: mtrl-addons builds on core, and core was reaching down into
// leaves. Each component now registers its own key by augmenting the
// interface from its own `types.ts`.
//
// This is a module-graph property, and a type fixture cannot see it — I tried.
// `test/types/contract-cleanup.fixture.ts` asserts the map's keys, but the old
// hardcoded map had those same keys, so reverting `global.ts` left every
// assertion true. Only reading the imports catches it.
