// The element classes this wave of FLO-120 renamed, pinned in the stylesheets.
//
// `classes:check` compares the names the source asks for against the names the
// stylesheets define, so it catches the rename landing on one side only. What
// it cannot catch is both sides moving back together: revert the component and
// its stylesheet and the two still agree, and the check stays green. That is
// what this file is for -- it names the migrated spelling directly, and fails
// if the dashed one comes back.
//
// The stylesheets are compiled here rather than read from dist/, for the same
// reason the check reads dist/ rather than the SCSS: `&__handle` nested inside
// `.#{$component}` is not the class name, and only the compiler knows that it
// is `mtrl-bottom-sheet__handle`.
