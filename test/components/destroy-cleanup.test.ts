// test/components/destroy-cleanup.test.ts
//
// / N30: whether components skip their own cleanup on destroy was
// unverified. Three earlier attempts to check every component at once were
// each confounded — a wrapper swap missed captured references, a mount-based
// check tripped over N29, and an event-based check could not detect the known
// N28 bypass even when run against the commit before its fix.
//
// This one observes only what a component cannot hide: what is left in the
// document after `destroy()`. Nothing is swapped, nothing is mounted, and no
// internal is read — the public factory is called, the component is destroyed,
// and the document is inspected. N29 is fixed, which is what makes
// the direct approach available now.
//
// Reading `component.resources` does NOT work as a check, and that is worth
// recording: the public API object does not re-expose the cleanup scope, so
// the scope reads as undefined from outside whether or not it ran. That is the
// same class of confound as the three earlier attempts.
//
// The sweep is driven by the component barrel rather than a hand-written list,
// so a new component is covered the day it is exported.
