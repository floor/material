// test/types/select-events.fixture.ts
//
// Select's *public* `on`/`off` were already generic over a `SelectEvents`
// map -- it and `list` are the two components that had one before FLO-114.
// What was not narrowed is the internal host, `BaseComponent` in the same
// file, which still declared `on?: (event: string, handler: Function)`.
//
// That one line is what made the pipe in select.ts fail to resolve under
// strictFunctionTypes: a host promising to call a handler with *anything*
// cannot accept a producer that takes a typed payload, because parameter
// positions are contravariant. The failure then typed every stage after it
// `unknown`, which is where select's other six errors came from.
//
// So the assertions here come in two halves: the public map, which guards
// against drift, and the host, which is what this change actually altered.
//
// Compiled by `bun run tooling:check` via test/types/tsconfig.json.
