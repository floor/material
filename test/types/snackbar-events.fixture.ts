//
// Snackbar's typed event map. Nothing here runs; the assertions are
// the test.
//
// Snackbar is a different starting point from button's. Its public `on`
// already took a typed event name and a typed payload --
// `(event: SnackbarEventType, handler: (event: SnackbarEvent) => void)` -- so
// a misspelled name was already caught. What was wrong was one level down:
// the internal `BaseComponent` host in the same file declared
// `on?: (event: string, handler: Function)`, wider than the producer it is
// handed, and under strictFunctionTypes that stopped the pipe in
// `snackbar.ts:37` from resolving, which typed every stage after it `unknown`.
//
// So the assertions below are mostly about keeping what was already true,
// while the map replaces a single union-and-one-payload signature with one
// that can tell its four events apart.
//
// Compiled by `bun run tooling:check` via test/types/tsconfig.json.

// literal token in prose: a comment beginning with it *is* a directive
// wherever it appears.)

// A misspelled event name.
// @ts-expect-error "closed" is not an event a snackbar reports

// An event that exists on other components but not this one.
// @ts-expect-error a snackbar has no "change" event
snackbar.on("change", () => {});

// The handler receives the payload, not the DOM event.
// @ts-expect-error a snackbar handler is not handed a MouseEvent
snackbar.on("action", (event: MouseEvent) => void event.preventDefault());

// And off is generic over the same keys.
// @ts-expect-error "closed" is not an event a snackbar reports
snackbar.off("closed", () => {});

// --- what it still allows -------------------------------------------------

snackbar.on("close", ({ reason, originalEvent }) => {
