// test/types/search-hosts.fixture.ts
//
// Search's internal hosts, narrowed to what their producers actually supply
// (FLO-114). Nothing here runs; the assertions are the test.
//
// Search contributed three errors and they were one failure with two
// shadows: the `pipe()` overload at search.ts:54 could not resolve, so every
// stage after it typed `unknown`, which is what lines 66 and 69 were
// reporting. Fixing the root cleared all three.
//
// The root was three separate hosts each declaring something *wider* than
// the producer handed to it -- the same contravariance as the rest of F14,
// once on a union and twice on a callback:
//
//   - `InputHost.states.setViewMode` took `string`; the producer takes
//     `SearchViewMode`, so the host promised to call it with any string;
//   - `SuggestionsHost.input.selectSuggestion` took `SearchSuggestion |
//     string`; the producer takes only the object, and the single call site
//     passes an element of `getSuggestions()`, which is `SearchSuggestion[]`;
//   - `InternalComponent.on/off` took `Function`, and the forwarder built
//     from it and `ApiOptions.events` had to follow.
//
// **What this file can and cannot reach.** Three of those four interfaces --
// `InputHost`, `SuggestionsHost`, `InternalComponent` -- are declared without
// `export`, which is why narrowing them is not a contract change. That also
// means a fixture cannot import them, and exporting them so a test could
// would add public surface to prove a private point. So the assertions below
// cover the one reachable seam, `getApiConfig`, and the other three are
// enforced by `ts:check`, which compiles search.ts with
// strictFunctionTypes on and fails if any of them widens again. That check is
// the detector; this file is the part of it that can be read.
//
// Compiled by `bun run tooling:check` via config/tsconfig.types.json.
