// test/types/button-events.fixture.ts
//
// The first component migrated to a typed event map (FLO-114). Nothing here
// runs; the assertions are the test.
//
// `on` and `off` took `(event: string, handler: Function)`. Two things follow
// from that, and both were real:
//
//   - a misspelled event name compiled and produced a listener that never
//     fired;
//   - a handler's argument was untyped, so every caller in the repository
//     guessed at it -- and four of them guessed wrong. `button-group`,
//     `dialog` and `split-button` (twice) each read the handler argument as
//     the DOM event, when the forwarder hands a
//     `{ event, element, originalEvent }` payload. `ButtonGroupEvent
//     .originalEvent` and `SplitButtonEvent.originalEvent` are declared
//     `Event` and held that object instead; `DialogButton.onClick` is
//     declared to take a `MouseEvent` and was handed it too.
//
// Typing the map is what surfaced all four. These assertions keep the map
// honest so it can keep doing that.
//
// Compiled by `bun run tooling:check` via test/types/tsconfig.json.
