//
// The FAB's typed event map. Nothing here runs; the assertions are
// the test.
//
// `on`/`off` took `(event: string, handler: Function)` on both the public
// `FabComponent` and the internal host in api.ts. Two consequences, and both
// were real for button when the same map was written there: a misspelled
// event name compiled and produced a listener that never fired, and the
// handler's argument was untyped, so a caller guessing "the DOM event" wrote
// something that type-checked and was wrong.
//
// The payload type is `ForwardedEventPayload`, which lives in core beside the
// forwarder that emits it rather than being redeclared here. Eleven
// components configure `forwardEvents`; without a shared payload each of
// their event maps would spell the same three fields again.
//
// Compiled by `bun run tooling:check` via test/types/tsconfig.json.
