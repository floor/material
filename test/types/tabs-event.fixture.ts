//
// What `handleTabClick` accepts. Nothing here runs; the assertions are the
// test, and each stops compiling if the declaration it covers drifts.
//
// The defect, from FLO-114: tabs declared this handler twice and the two
// declarations contradicted each other. `types.ts` and the internal hosts said
// `(event: unknown, tab)`; `api.ts` and one host in `features.ts` said
// `(event: Event, tab)`. Both were wrong, in opposite directions:
//
//   - `unknown` is too wide. Under `strictFunctionTypes` a host promising to
//     call the handler with anything cannot accept one that takes an `Event`,
//     which is what made the tabs pipe fail to resolve and put every stage
//     after it at `unknown`.
//   - `Event` is too narrow. `utils.ts` calls `handleTabClick(null, target)`
//     on purpose, routing an arrow key through the same path as a click when
//     there is no event to cancel.
//
// `Event | null` is what the code actually does, so it is what the type says.
// The `false` assertions below are not decoration: an `Equals` that has gone
// vacuous passes against anything, so each wrong shape is named and required
// to be wrong.
//
// Compiled by `bun run tooling:check` via test/types/tsconfig.json.
