// test/types/card-host.fixture.ts
//
// Card's internal host and the component it is actually handed (FLO-114).
// Nothing here runs; the assertions are the test.
//
// This one is not an event map. Card's `BaseComponent` -- internal, exported
// from its types.ts but not from its index.ts -- declared
// `getClass: (name?: string) => string`, with the name optional. The
// component the pipe hands it comes from core, where `getClass` requires a
// name and is implemented as `${prefix}-${name}`.
//
// Under strictFunctionTypes that is unsound in the direction that matters: a
// host promising it may call `getClass()` with no argument cannot accept a
// function that requires one. It is the same contravariance as the
// `Function` vs `EventCallback` roots elsewhere in F14, on a different
// method, and it is what stopped the pipe at card.ts:103 resolving.
//
// Card was the only component declaring the optional form. No call anywhere
// in src or test passes no name, and a bare call would have returned
// "mtrl-undefined", so nothing depended on the wider declaration.
//
// Compiled by `bun run tooling:check` via config/tsconfig.types.json.

// built by the time `withAPI` runs, and its `getClass` must be assignable to
// the host's. With the optional declaration it was not, and every stage after
// the failing `pipe()` overload became `unknown`.
//
// config/tsconfig.types.json now inherits strict mode, so this assignment also
// checks the host's parameter variance. The structural assertions above and
// below remain useful under config/tsconfig.test.json, which relaxes that flag.
// `bun run ts:check` checks the real composition pipeline in strict mode.
