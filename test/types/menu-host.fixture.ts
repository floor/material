// test/types/menu-host.fixture.ts
//
// Menu's internal host, `MenuFeatureHost`, declared twelve manager methods as
// `(...args: unknown[]) => unknown`. That is wider than any of the producers,
// and under `strictFunctionTypes` a host promising to call a method with
// *anything* cannot accept one that takes typed parameters — which is what
// made the pipe in menu.ts fail to resolve, typing every stage after it
// `unknown` and producing menu's other three errors.
//
// The signatures are now taken from the implementations in `features/`. They
// are asserted here because the placeholder they replaced was accepted by
// everything, so nothing else notices if one drifts back.
//
// Note what the placeholders were hiding. Typing them surfaced four real
// disagreements, all fixed in the same commit:
//
//   - `handleSubmenuLeave` takes no parameters, and the mouseleave handler in
//     controller.ts was passing it the event, which was silently discarded;
//   - `currentItems()` was annotated `unknown[]` through a cast, throwing away
//     the `MenuContent[]` it actually returns;
//   - `activeSubmenus` was being passed into `setupKeyboardHandlers` and never
//     read by it;
//   - three submenu actions were passed as `null` when `component.submenu` is
//     absent, and keyboard.ts calls all four of them unguarded. `withSubmenu`
//     is unconditional in the pipe, so the null never occurs today — but the
//     guard the ternary was reaching for did not work. They are optional now,
//     and called through `?.`.
//
