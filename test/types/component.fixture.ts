// test/types/component.fixture.ts
//
// Type-level checks that a chaining method reports the component it was called
// on, not the interface that happens to declare it. Nothing here runs; the
// assertions are the test, and each one stops compiling if the declaration it
// covers goes back to naming a fixed interface.
//
// The defect these cover, from FLO-235: `addClass` was declared
// `(...classes: string[]) => ElementComponent`. At runtime it returns `this`,
// which by the time anyone can call it carries every feature the pipe applied.
// Declaring the narrow interface threw all of that away, so
// `component.addClass("x")` handed back a bare element component and the rest
// of the component's own API was gone from the type.
//
// Compiled by `bun run tooling:check` via test/types/tsconfig.json.
