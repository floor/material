 *
 *   bun run scripts/check-adapter-types.ts react
 *
 * The `*-types:floor` scripts install the lowest version `peerDependencies`
 * allows (react and `@types/react` together, at react's floor) and then run
 * this. The consumer in `scripts/fixtures/peer-types` uses a component with a
 * prop and an event, and `@ts-expect-error` on a wrong prop type, so a
 * declaration that collapsed to `any` fails here.
