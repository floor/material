// Type-checks the test tree against the real shipped source.
//
// `test/tsconfig.json` (then tsconfig.test.json) existed for months and ran never. Two faults kept it
// from reading a single test file: `noStrictGenericChecks` was removed from
// TypeScript (a hard config error on 5.x), and a `typeRoots` override excluded
// node_modules, so the bun type library was never found. Both are fixed; this
// script is what stops it rotting again.
//
// Why a gate over a file list rather than a plain `tsc -p`:
//
//   With the config running, the tree reported 235 errors, none in src/. About
//   sixty were ordinary fixture looseness in real suites and were fixed. The
//   rest, 174, sit in the 20 component suites below. Each asserts against a mock
//   defined in its own file rather than the shipped factory, and each mock has
//   drifted from the component it claims to stand in for -- which is what a
//   `TS2339` on a mock says. That is finding F6. Gating the whole tree would be
//   red on arrival and get switched off.
//
//   So the gate covers everything else, and names these. Porting a suite to
//   the real factory is then a one-line deletion from the list below, and the
//   list is the public record of how far F6 has to go.
//
// The exclusions shrink. They never grow: adding a file here means a suite
// that used to type-check no longer does, which is a regression, not a chore.
//
